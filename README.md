This is a basic chess engine featuring move validation, random legal moves for the computer opponent, and handling for castling and pawn promotion. It also includes detection for checkmate and stalemate.

Using chess-api.com, I implemented an option to play against Stockfish, which is significantly smarter than the random legal moves option.
